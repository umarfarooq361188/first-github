# there are many libraries already store in python and so we didn't require use any function of our task beacuse it's available in library
# for example, to find the value of "pi" we use "math" library. i.e
# import math

# to find value of pi

import math
x="Value of pi is "
y=math.pi
print(x, y)

# to find the mean value of given data, we use statistics

import statistics
x=[100,120,130,140,150,180,200,210,220,230,240,250,300,310,320,330,355,360]
y=statistics.mean(x)
print("mean of x is ", y)
